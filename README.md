## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The client portal uses a modern, component-based architecture:

- **App Router**: Leverages Next.js 14's App Router for server components and routing
- **Hybrid Rendering**: Uses both server and client components strategically
- **API Routes**: Implements API routes for secure data operations
- **Authentication Flow**: Client and server-side auth verification
- **Database Access**: Row Level Security (RLS) for controlled data access
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state

## üìä Database Schema

The application uses the following primary data models:

- **Profiles**: Extended user information for authentication
- **Projects**: Client projects with various status options and timelines
- **Tasks**: Deliverables and action items linked to projects
- **Meetings**: Scheduled appointments with metadata and recordings
- **Documents**: Files and agreements with versioning and signatures
- **Time Packages**: Purchased time blocks for tracking utilization
- **Time Entries**: Detailed time usage records

All models implement Row Level Security to ensure clients only access their own data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrewRevelate/client-portal.git
cd client-portal
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Environment setup**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

4. **Database setup**

- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Open the SQL Editor
- Run the initialization script from `supabase/migrations/00000000000000_initial_schema.sql`

5. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Access the development site**

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## üîí Authentication Implementation

The portal uses a comprehensive authentication system:

### Authentication Methods

### Security Features
- JWT token-based sessions with automatic renewal
- Server-side verification for protected routes
- Secure password reset workflow
- Account recovery options
- CSRF protection

### Implementation Details
- Uses Supabase Auth UI components with custom styling
- Implements client and server auth providers
- Middleware protection for authenticated routes
- Custom hooks for auth state management

## üîÑ Deployment Workflow

The application is automatically deployed through a CI/CD pipeline:

1. Code changes are pushed to GitHub
2. Vercel automatically detects the changes
3. Build process runs with environment variables
4. Application is deployed to Vercel's global edge network
5. Deployment is verified and monitored

### Environment Configuration

The following environment variables must be set in Vercel:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

Before deployment, the portal undergoes:

- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint static code analysis
- Component testing
- End-to-end functionality tests
- Responsive design verification
- Performance optimization
- Security auditing

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Authentication Problems
- Verify Supabase credentials in environment variables
- Check that redirect URLs are properly configured
- Review browser console for CORS-related errors
- Ensure cookies are being properly set and read

### Database Access Issues
- Verify RLS policies are correctly configured
- Check for permission errors in Supabase logs
- Test database queries directly in Supabase interface

### Deployment Failures
- Review build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Clear browser cache after deployments
- Check for TypeScript or dependency errors
